This is the graphical user interface for Pd, that communicates with Pd via a
network socket.
Normally, Pd will automatically start this user interface for you.
However, if you want to run Pd and pd-gui on different machines, you will have
to launch the GUI manually.

If you specify 
.IR server:port ,
pd-gui will try to connect to Pd running on the remote
.IR server
and listening on 
.IR port .

If you do not specify anything, pd-gui will simply launch Pd for you.
