Description: realtime computer music and graphics system 
 Pure Data (also known as Pd) is a real-time graphical programming environment
 for audio and graphics processing. Pd's audio functions are built-in;
 graphical computations require separate packages such as gem (Graphics
 Environment for Multimedia) or pd-pdp (Pd Packet).
