# 'puredata' is a meta-package depending on puredata-gui (providing the
#  graphical user interface, run by /usr/lib/puredata/tcl/pd-gui.tcl) and
#  puredata-core (prodiving the core of the program).  As of 0.43, it is now
#  possible to install and run puredata-gui alone without puredata-core.
#  Since the desktop entry only makes sense if both the core and the GUI are
#  available, it is installed by the meta package.
