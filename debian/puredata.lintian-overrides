# 'puredata' is a meta-package depending on puredata-core (providing
# /usr/bin/puredata) and puredata-gui (providing a graphical user interface
# which gets automatically used); since the desktop entry only makes sense if
# both the core and the GUI are available, it is installed by the meta package.
