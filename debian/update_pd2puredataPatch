## this is a small helper-script to ease updating
## of debian/patches/pd2puredata
##
## the problem with that patch is, that the line that
## needs to be changed contains the version number, and
## is thus updated by upstream for each release, which
## makes quilt fail.
## this script will replace the last-version number in the
## patch by the current version number
