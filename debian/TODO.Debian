TODO for the 0.43 packages:

 make sure upgrade works as expected!
    manually installing:
         dpkg -i puredata puredata-doc puredata-core puredata-gui puredata-extra puredata-utils puredata-dev

    upgrade:
		0.43.0-4 	-> 0.43.0-5	OK
		0.42.6-1+b1 	-> 0.43.0-5	OK
		0.42.6-1+b1 -> 0.43.0-4 -> 0.43.0-5	OK


    i really hould create a file:/// repository and install from there!
